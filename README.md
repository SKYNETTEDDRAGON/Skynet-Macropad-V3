# Skynet-Macropad-V3
My first ever macropad :)

#Overview:
- I love drawing and making things on my computer, be it video games (my fav), systems, or drawing on procreate. I wanted a shortcut keyboard of some kind since forever - at the time I didn't know the name - and eventually when I first joined HackClub I found Blueprint, which showed me an awesome tutorial on how to build a macropad. Since I had never touched a PCB, much less built one, I decided to challenge myself into stepping into the world of hardware. Hence, my first ever macropad!  


##PCB:
I wanted to make a sipler version of a macropad sicne this is my first ever hardware project, hence I stuck to only adding 2 extra keys (6 keys in total) to my project. Here is the schematic: <img width="806" height="490" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b54c4f67-26ff-4cca-a621-ac90678f4ef2" /> (sorry if it's a bit messy)
and here's my schematic:

##CAD:

Here's a pic of how everything in my design fits together:

##Firmware:

Since my design for the whole keyboard itself wasn't too complex, my code wasn't either. While I initially suffered with my computer not being able to compile basic python, I eventually was able to make it do so, and FINALLY run the code properly.

##BOM:

- 4 M3x16mm screws
- 6 Blank DSA black keycaps
- 6 MX-Style switches
- 1 Seeed XIAO RP2040
